# BasinsProbe_Code
Repository associated with the paper 'Distinct hippocampal network states support theta phase precession and theta sequences in CA1' by Matteo Guardamagna, Federico Stella, Francesco Battaglia. This MATLAB code allows to compute regions of significant phase-amplitude coupling for arbitrary frequencies, across probe contacts.
